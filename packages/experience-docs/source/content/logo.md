# Logo

Our logo mark is comprised of two important elements: hearts and connection. Everyday heroes are passionate about the causes they support and enjoy connecting with a community of like minded people.

## Resources

### Primary Logo

The primary logo consists of the heart logomark, and the Everydayhero name, in lowercase. Wherever possible, this is the preferred logo for use.

### Heart Logomark

The Everydayhero heart logomark acts as a short-form signature, and is only used in specific contexts.

### “Powered by” Logo

When Everydayhero’s brand is diminished, such as for campaign pages, bespoke sites for charities and events, and white-label products, the “powered by everydayhero” logo should be displayed centred towards the bottom of the primary content. 

### Reversed logos

The preferred logo application is full colour on a white background. In any context where a white background is not possible, the reversed logo or logomark should be used.

### Everydayhero in writing

Everydayhero is always one word, and is capitalized when written out in text. Always use the same typeface you are using for the rest of the text. Always spell out Everydayhero in English–never translated into another language.

## Usage Guidelines
 
### Primary Logo

- Never modify the logo colours, proportions, or opacity of either the heart logomark or ‘everydayhero’ name
- Never apply any effects to the logo, including shadows, emboss, glows, etc
- Never rotate, flip, or skew the logo, or scale its dimensions independently
- Never remove either the heart logomark or ‘everydayhero’ name
- Never repeat the logo as a pattern/background, or apply it as a watermark
- Never place any text, images, or shapes, transparent or otherwise, overlapping any part of the logo
- Never place the logo on a non-white or image background
- Never append any words to the end of the ‘everydayhero’ name
- Never attempt to recreate the logo, or depict it in an artistic style
- Never display at a size that would render the ‘everydayhero’ name smaller than 12pt (print) or 16px (web) in font-size
- Never let any page or frame edge, or any element of any kind, encroach within the safe zone (defined as the height of the letter ‘v’ in ‘everydayhero’) surrounding the logo

### Heart Logomark

In addition to all the usage guidelines that apply to the primary logo, the heart logomark should also only ever be used in the following circumstances: 

- The logo must appear inside a square
- There is sufficient brand context for viewers to identify it as Everydayhero’s logomark, examples include: 
  - Social media profiles
  - Emails sent in response to a user action within our ecosystem
  - Internal office signage

In all other circumstances, the primary logo must be used.

- Never use as bullet points, borders, patterns, or design embellishment: only ever as a brand identifier
- Never display smaller than 1cm (print) or 50px (web) in width
- Never let any page or frame edge, or any element of any kind, encroach within the safe zone surrounding the logo (shown below)

### "Powered by" Logo

In addition to all the usage guidelines that apply to the primary logo, the “powered by” logo should: 

- Always be centred
- Never be displayed smaller than 2.5cm (print) or 150px (web)

### Reversed Logos

In addition to all the usage guidelines that apply to the primary logo and heart logomark, reversed logo usage must follow these additional rules:

- Never display the reversed logos on a light background, or perceptually bright colour background (like yellow or lavender)
- Never display the reversed logos on a high-contrast image, where portions of the image approach lighter than 30% grey
- Never display the reversed logos imposed over a person’s face
