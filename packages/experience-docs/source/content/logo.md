# Logo

Our logo mark is comprised of two important elements: hearts and connection. Everyday heroes are passionate about the causes they support and enjoy connecting with a community of like minded people.

## Guidelines

### Logomark

When the logo mark is used on its own this version should be used. Notice the extra line to the right of the heart in this version of the logo mark.

### Primary Logo

The horizontal version of the logo is to be used primarily. When used on white or on a clear light area of a photo, use the positive colour version. On dark backgrounds and dark photos, use the reverse colour version. When the green heart does not have enough contrast against the background colour, use the mono reverse version.

Never change the size of the logo mark and the typography independently. They belong together as supplied and should never be resized as two separate elements.

Never show the words “everydayhero” without the heart. They belong together as supplied and should not be separated. You can use the heart independently, but make sure you use the version that includes the extra line to the right of the heart (described in the Logomark section).

Never replace text next the heart where the words “everydayhero” would otherwise go.

Never repeat the heart multiple times or use as a text bullet.
