## Goals

### Unity

We provide numerous products that make a difference in peoples lives each day. Bringing them all together into a cohesive experience amplifies their value and ensures we become the platform of choice for those who want to make a positive impact on the world.

### Productivity

As we grow and the demands of our platform increase, taking the time to make decisions up front increases team throughput and consistency, and allows us to focus on the hard problems.

## Guide

```

- **Internalise our Principles.** These are what make us uniquely Everydayhero and help guide each decision we make.
- **Check out Logo, Colors, & Typography.** These should be your only source for this information. There are downloadable assets in each section.
- **Voice & Tone guides how we talk to our customers.** This is particularly important for our direct communications.

This is still early stages of the Experience System, so what we need most is feedback. To be effective, we need input from every team at Everydayhero.

Wether it’s about a single icon or an entire missing section you think is missing, we want to hear from you.

To help, every page has a feedback button at the bottom. Just like the one below.
