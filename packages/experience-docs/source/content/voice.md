**Capture**: calls to action, input labels, and such should be written in first person, as though the user were speaking a command to a butler (or siri). Examples: “Give Claire $50”, “I will donate $50”, “My email address is:”, “Download my receipt”, “I want the charity to contact me to support my fundraising journey”, etc.

## EVERYTHING BELOW IS OLD: Taken from the github wiki

Use this section as a guide any time you are writing for everydayhero, whether it is on the company blog, the Wonderwall, social media or any other platform.

For most questions, refer to the AP Stylebook. It is the standard style and usage guide in the news industry and provides guidelines on everything from comma usage to state and country abbreviations. The online version can be found here: https://www.apstylebook.com/.

## Grammar, Punctuation and Capitalization

When you post on the blog or social media, you’re representing everydayhero. We strive to be a trusted company that people look up to. One way to accomplish this is by always presenting a professional face to the world through polished content. The guidelines here will help keep everything clear and consistent across all of our platforms, no matter who is writing.

**Acronyms**: Do not assume that everyone knows what the acronym you’re using means. Always spell out what it stands for on first mention with the acronym following in parentheses. After the first mention, use the acronym.

Example:

> Team in Training raises funds for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS).

NOT:

> Team in Training raises funds for the LLS.

**Ampersand**: Avoid unless part of a proper name or tagline.

Company and product names: Follow an organization’s conventions as to how it capitalizes and punctuates its names.

Example:

> iPhone users enjoy applications.

NOT:

> IPhone users enjoy applications.

**Em dash**: Do not put spaces around the dashes that separate it from the words that precede and follow it. An em dash is a long, single dash (—). In Google Docs, you can make this by pressing Option + Shift + Hyphen. In Microsoft Word, put two hyphens together (--) and it will automatically make an em dash.

**Exclamation marks**: Never use more than one exclamation mark in a sentence. Use exclamation marks sparingly throughout copy.

**Nonprofit**: One word, not hyphenated.

**Numbers**: Spell out all numbers less than 10. Keep all numbers 10 and above as numerals.

**Percentages**: Use the percentage sign (%). Do not spell out numbers associated with percentages.

Example:

> He raised 4% more than expected.

NOT:

> He raised four percent more than expected.

**Spaces**: Use one space after periods and at the end of sentences.

**Time**: Use a.m. and p.m. (not AM or A.M.) to indicate time of day.

**Titles**: Titles and title case are only to be used in headlines and headers (e.g. Wonderwall post titles, section headers on the company blog). This means only using capital letters for principal words and keeping articles, conjunctions and prepositions lowercase.

Example:

> #BehindtheScenes: Down and Dirty for a Good Cause

NOT:

> #BehindtheScenes: Down And Dirty For A Good Cause

**Wonderwall**: All one word with a capital letter at the beginning.
