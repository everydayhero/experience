# Icons

Constructed from a predefined set of lines and shapes, no straight or custom lines used. Build on a 512px x 512px artboard. 
**Colors**: any color from our brand palette. Try to limit to 3 colors at most, but fewer is better.
**Outlines**: Charcoal set to X% opacity, overlayed above a base color, minimum of Xpx stroke width. 
**Shadows**: Charcoal set to X-Y% opacity, overlayed above a base color. No shadows cast by the icon onto a background; only internal shading.
**Highlights**: White set to X-Y% opacity, overlayed above a base color. Highlights should not touch or extend across outlines, or cross multiple adjacent colors.
