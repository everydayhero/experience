## Notes/Thoughts

- No colours perceptually darker than our charcoal (use instagram-like filters to constrain the levels and brighten the shadows).
- Consider: gradient mapping in monochromatic tones of a single brand/themed color (Lukeâ€™s Meetup example)
- Narrow depth of field (low f-stop, preferably 1.4-2)
- Themes: triumph, perseverance, effort, people comforting other people, people celebrating other people,  etc.
